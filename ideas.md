  **Design Movement**: Eco-Modern Professionalism
  **Core Principles**: Clarity, Trust, Efficiency, Approachability
  **Color Philosophy**: A sophisticated palette rooted in nature but refined for business. Deep forest green (#1A4D2E) conveys stability and eco-consciousness, paired with a vibrant lime accent (#76B82A) for energy ratings and calls to action. Clean white backgrounds ensure readability and a clinical, professional feel.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Asymmetric Split-Screen Hero. Instead of a standard centered hero, use a split layout where the left side focuses on the value proposition and "Instant Quote" CTA, while the right side features a high-quality image of a modern home or energy efficiency concept. Section transitions use subtle diagonal lines to suggest forward movement and energy.
  **Signature Elements**:
    - "Energy Rating" motif: Use the A-G color bars as a subtle design element in dividers or bullet points.
    - Floating "Trust Cards": Testimonials and accreditations displayed as slightly elevated cards with soft shadows.
    - Circular/Organic shapes for profile images to soften the technical nature of EPCs.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Direct and reassuring. Buttons have a solid, tactile feel with a slight lift on hover. Forms are broken down into simple, non-intimidating steps.
  **Animation**: Gentle fade-ins for content as the user scrolls. The "Instant Quote" button pulses very subtly to draw attention. Energy rating bars animate (fill up) when the page loads.
  **Typography System**:
    - Headings: 'Outfit' (Google Font) - A geometric sans-serif that feels modern and friendly.
    - Body: 'Open Sans' - Highly readable, professional, and neutral.

  **Design Movement**: Technical Transparency / "Blueprint" Aesthetic
  **Core Principles**: Precision, Detail, Expertise, Reliability
  **Color Philosophy**: Technical blue (#0F4C81) as the primary anchor, representing engineering and standards. Accents of safety orange (#FF6B35) for critical actions. Backgrounds use a very faint grid pattern to reinforce the "survey/measurement" aspect of the service.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Modular Grid. Content is organized into clearly defined blocks or "modules" with visible but thin borders, reminiscent of a technical report or certificate. This structure communicates that the service is organized and thorough.
  **Signature Elements**:
    - Thin line iconography: Icons that look like architectural drawings.
    - Monospace data points: displaying prices or stats in a monospace font to look like data.
    - "Stamp" style badges for "Qualified" and "Insured".
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Precise and snappy. Hover effects are instant color swaps or border thickening, no soft fades.
  **Animation**: Elements "draw" themselves in (stroke animation) or slide into place with mechanical precision.
  **Typography System**:
    - Headings: 'Space Grotesk' - Technical, slightly quirky but very professional.
    - Body: 'Roboto' - Standard, clean, and efficient.

  **Design Movement**: Warm Local Professional
  **Core Principles**: Personal Connection, Local Expertise, Simplicity, Warmth
  **Color Philosophy**: Warm greys and soft teals (#2A9D8F) to move away from the cold corporate feel. The goal is to emphasize Hilary as a *person* helping you, not a faceless agency. A touch of terracotta (#E76F51) for warmth and urgency.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Card-Based Storytelling. The site flows like a narrative: "Who is Hilary?", "Why do you need an EPC?", "How much does it cost?". Sections are distinct "cards" on a soft background.
  **Signature Elements**:
    - Hand-drawn highlights: Subtle underlining or circling of key terms to feel "annotated" by a human.
    - Photography focus: Highlighting the photo of Hilary and local Southampton landmarks/architecture.
    - Soft rounded corners (1rem+) on everything to feel friendly.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Soft and fluid. Buttons have a "squishy" feel (scale down slightly on click).
  **Animation**: Elements float gently into place. Parallax effect on local imagery.
  **Typography System**:
    - Headings: 'Merriweather' - A trustworthy serif that feels established and academic yet warm.
    - Body: 'Lato' - Friendly and round sans-serif.
